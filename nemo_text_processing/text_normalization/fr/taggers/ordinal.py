    Finite state transducer for classifying ordinal

    This class converts ordinal up to the millionth (millonésimo) order (exclusive).

    This FST also records the ending of the ordinal (called "morphosyntactic_features"):
    either as gender_masc, gender_fem, or apocope. Also introduces plural feature for non-deterministic graphs.

    Args:
        cardinal: CardinalFst
        deterministic: if True will provide a single transduction option,
            for False multiple transduction are generated (used for audio-based normalization)
